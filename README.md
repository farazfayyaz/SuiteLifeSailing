# SuiteLifeSailing

Group webpage project where we collaborated and created a design for a fake cruise agency. 
We each created a landing page, added information, and communicated revisions and concerns.
I created the CSS file, interactive navigation bar, and consistent styling across each webpage.

# What I Learned
- Css styling and UX/UI design rules
- Flex Box model
- Divs and Containers
- Consistent styling
- Interactive navigation bar
